##Isn't meditation new age bullshit?

No. Meditation is ancient, but it's not bullshit.

It's not about trying to levitate, travel to parallel dimensions or talk to the dead.

Meditation is simply a certain kind of focused thinking.

Your mind is like a glass of water. Put it down.

## Cool. How do I do it?
Broadly, there are a lot of ways to meditate, like there are a ton of ways to make music.
There are three main kinds of meditation, like guitar. You have classical, acoustic and electric meditation. Just kidding.

We recommend you start first with samatha, focused attention. For a little endorsement of this particular brand, it's the
kind of meditation that the Budhha did.

#### Focused attention 
You focus your thoughts towards your breath. Any time you think about what's for dinner, task you have to do, any external thoughts, you should
gently steer your mind back to the breath.


Your mind is a monkey, so don't worry if it happens a thousand times in the first few sittings. It is even worse to think "oh I'm having all
these thoughts, this is bad, I'm not meditating right", because that's a negative reaction. Just notice the thought and go back ot the breath.


Don't worry if it's boring or anything. A lot of people try meditation and then stop, because it feels like all you're doing is "sitting there".
That's the point!  You are learning to sit still, and watch your body and your thoughts as they arise.

#### Compassion meditation
> "You yourself, as much as anybody in the entire universe, deserve your love and affection" - Buddha

It is great to start or end your sessions with a few minutes of compassion meditation. It really focuses and makes you a better person.
Essentially, you inwardly direct love at yourself and others. It's dumb to hate. 

There is a script:

    May I be filled with loving kindness.
    May I be safe from inner and outer dangers.
    May I be well in body and mind.
    May I be at ease and happy.

You think it. It feels good. A lot of times you let yourself down, and start disliking yourself. Self hate is terrible thing. Especially since you can choose to love yourself.
It's been noted that this kind of meditation really helps to focus better, that "loving" others clears the mind. A good thing to start with would be 5 minutes of loving kindess followed by 10 of
focused attention.

Then you replace it with someone else. Family members, for example. You repeat the phrase. Then, slowly expand this into a circle of people you 
are wishing well: your family, your friends, people you know, people you hate. any point you can choose to go back to a previous group.

###Posture
Don't I have to do yoga to meditate? Do I have to be a flexible gymnast and cross my legs?
No. The Lotus position (pic below) is the preferred position of meditators. You can sit that way for whole days without moving.
Beginners though, find it hard to position themselves. You can also use a chair.

*    Half Lotus
*    Cross Legged
*    Sit normally on a chair
