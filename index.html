            <h2>Why Meditation?</h2>

            <h3>Isn't meditation some ancient yogic art or new age bullshit?</h3>
            <p> 
            No.
            <br>
            Well, meditation is ancient, but it's not about trying to levitate, travel to parallel dimensions or talk to the dead.
            </p>

            <h3> What is meditation?</h3>

            <p>
            Meditation is simply a certain kind of focused thinking. You eventually get pretty good at focusing in general. There are
            tremendous benefits. It overflows into other parts of life and sharpens your mind, making life high defintion.  </p>

            <h3>
                Cool. How do I do it?
            </h3>
            <p>
            There are three main kinds of meditation, like guitar. You have acoustic, classical and electric meditation. Just kidding.
            <br>
            We recommend you start first with focused attention:
            </p>
            <h4>
                Focused attention
            </h4>
            <p>
            You focus your thoughts towards your breath. Any time you think about what's for dinner, task you have to do, any external thoughts, you should
            gently steer your mind back to the breath.

            <br>
            Your mind is a monkey, so don't worry if it happens a thousand times in the first few sittings. It is even worse to think "oh I'm having all
            these thoughts, this is bad, I'm not meditating right", because that's a negative reaction. Just notice the thought and go back ot the breath.

            Don't worry if it's boring or anything. A lot of people try meditation and then stop, because it feels like all you're doing is "sitting there". That's the point!
            You are learning to sit still, and watch your body
            The goal is notice your thoughts as they arise, and get better control over your self. Focused attention is what Budhha did.
            </p>

            <h4>
                Love and kindness.
            </h4>
            "You, above any body or thing else in the universe, deserve your own love". Buddha
            <br>
            Essentially, you inwardly direct love at yourself and others. It's dumb to hate. 
            <br>
            There is a script:
            <pre>
            May I be filled with lovingkindness.
            May I be safe from inner and outer dangers.
            May I be well in body and mind.
            May I be at ease and happy.</pre>

            You think it. You It feels good. A lot of times you let yourself down, and start disliking yourself. Self hate is terrible thing. Especially since you can choose to love yourself.

            <br>
            Then you open up to people close to you. Your family. You repeat the phrase. At any point you can choose to go back to a previous group.
            Your friends. People you know. People you hate.
            It's been noted that this kind of meditation really helps to focus better, that "loving" others clears the mind. A good thing to start with would be 5 minutes of loving kindess followed by 10 of
            focused attention.

            <h4>
                Mindfulness meditation
            </h4>
            You don't focus. You let every senstation in. If you feel itchy, you watch the itch. You watch everything.
            You notice a ton of things. You notice your thoughts coming up in response to your sensation.
            <h3>Posture</h3>
            <p>Don't I have to do yoga to meditate? Do I have to be a flexible gymnast and cross my legs?<p>
            <p>No. The Lotus position (pic below) is the preferred position of meditators. You can sit that way for whole days without moving.
            Beginners though, find it hard to position themselves. You can also</p>
            <h4>Half Lotus</h4>
                (maybe pic of half lotus?)
                <h4>Cross Legged</h4>
                <h4>Sit normally on a chair</h4>

            <h3>Resources</h3>
            <p>List some books here, websites, wiki pages</p>
            <ul>

                <li> Crazy things yogis can do that are backed by science:</li>
                <li> Jhana states: Eventually you can focus your mind so well that you can ignore your senses, and even your body.
                This is very similar to a sensory deprivation state (Paper link). These are called "jhana" states and they are real, not levitation hocus pocus.
