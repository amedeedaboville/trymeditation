        Meditation is an amazing tool for life. It trains different circuits in your brain.

        It overflows into other parts of life and sharpens your mind, making life high defintion.

        It's not about trying to levitate, travel to parallel dimensions or talk to the dead.
        It just practicing a certain kind of focused thinking, different from our to day to day task achieving.

     title: But seriously, I just can't meditate.

        There are a lot of ways to meditate, like there are a ton of ways to make music.
        Meditation is like guitar. You have classical, acoustic and electric meditation. Just kidding.

        We recommend you start first with samatha, focused attention. For a little endorsement of this particular brand, it's the
        kind of meditation that Budhha did. It's worked for centuries and is easy to pick up and see results with.

     title: Focused Attention
     content: |
        You focus your thoughts towards your breath. Any time you think about what's for dinner, task you have to do, any external thoughts, you should
        gently steer your mind back to the breath.


        Your mind is a monkey, so don't worry if it happens a thousand times in the first few sittings. It is even worse to think "oh I'm having all
        these thoughts, this is bad, I'm not meditating right", because that's a negative reaction. Just notice the thought and go back ot the breath.


        Don't worry if it's boring or anything. A lot of people try meditation and then stop, because it feels like all you're doing is "sitting there".
        That's the point!  You are learning to sit still, and watch your body and your thoughts as they arise.

        Don't I have to do yoga to meditate? Do I have to be a flexible gymnast and cross my legs?
        No. The Lotus position (pic below) is the preferred position of meditators. You can sit that way for whole days without moving.
        Beginners though, find it hard to position themselves. You can also use a chair.

        *    Half Lotus
        *    Cross Legged
        *    Sit normally on a chair

     title: Compassion Meditation
     content: |
        > You yourself, as much as anybody in the entire universe, deserve your love and affection - Buddha

        It is great to start or end your sessions with a few minutes of compassion meditation. It really focuses and makes you a better person.
        Essentially, you inwardly direct love at yourself and others. It sounds new agey, but it's really an amazing tool. You get rid of your
        negative views of yourself, and give people the benefit of the doubt more often, and become less irritable.

        There is a script:

            May I be filled with loving kindness.
            May I be safe from mental and physical dangers.
            May I be healthy in body and mind.
            May I be at ease and happy.

        You think it. It feels good. A lot of times you let yourself down, and start disliking yourself. Self hate is terrible thing, especially since you can choose to love yourself.
        It's been noted that this kind of meditation really helps to focus better, that it clears the mind. A good thing to start with would be 5 minutes of loving kindess followed by 10 of
        focused attention.

        Then you replace it with someone else. Family members, for example. You repeat the phrase. Then, slowly expand this into a circle of people you 
        are wishing well: your family, your friends, people you know, people you hate. any point you can choose to go back to a previous group.
